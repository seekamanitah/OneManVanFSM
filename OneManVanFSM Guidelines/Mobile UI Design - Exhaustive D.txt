### Mobile UI Design - Exhaustive Description

**Overview and Purpose**:
The mobile UI design for the OneManVan HVAC FSM app is conceptualized as a native companion to the desktop web app, prioritizing a clean, modern, work-focused experience tailored for field technicians (techs) who spend their days on-site rather than in an office. While the desktop web provides full administrative access with comprehensive overviews (e.g., multi-tabbed dashboards for owners/dispatchers to manage territorial assignments or multi-site landlord bids), the mobile app strips down to essentials: Quick access to assigned jobs, time tracking, site/asset details, material logging, and fast captures like quick notes or document uploads—ensuring techs can execute tasks efficiently without unnecessary navigation or data overload. This design promotes user-friendly efficiency by leveraging shared data from the desktop (e.g., a job scheduled in the web's Calendar prepopulates the mobile app's work order with site access notes, asset history, and suggested material lists from templates), minimizing re-entry and enabling seamless progression (e.g., log a repair on mobile ? data transfers to update asset history, deduct inventory, and flag for invoice generation back on desktop).

For a small HVAC contractor, the mobile UI thinks like a tech: Hands-free where possible (e.g., voice for quick notes on "Refrigerant levels low at Zone 2"), camera for uploading evidence to documents/history/claims, and offline-first for remote sites (e.g., log time/materials without signal, sync later to update shared entities like jobs/financials). HVAC-specific: Focus on quick checks like asset warranty status (e.g., "Expiring Soon—Log Claim?") or material suggestions (e.g., "14" Flex Duct" based on site sq ft/zones). Generic foundation: Adaptable for other trades without UI rework—e.g., repurpose "Duct Leak Check" prompts for "Pipe Burst Inspection" in plumbing (customizable via Settings' trade mode, which propagates prepopulated dropdowns like "Issue Type" to mobile), ensuring the app scales (e.g., electrical techs see "Circuit Overload Log" instead). Business value: Techs focus on work (clean, gesture-based UI reduces taps), while shared data ensures robustness—no "I forgot to log that" leading to invoice errors; instead, mobile captures (e.g., photo of installed grille) transfer to desktop for owner review in reports or customer summaries. For territorial companies or multi-site landlords (e.g., batch repairs across rentals), mobile filters by tech's assigned territory (e.g., East County jobs only for John Doe), with notifications routing correctly.

The mobile app is native (e.g., .NET MAUI for cross-platform Android/iOS), but the web app's responsive design serves as a fallback for browser access on mobile devices (e.g., if native app not installed, web scales down to similar layout with bottom nav). This hybrid ensures consistency: Same icons/colors/themes (light/dark from Settings), shared data sync (e.g., job updates from desktop push to mobile via SignalR/cloud), and customizable elements (prepopulated dropdowns like "Priority: Emergency" editable in Settings to add "Routine Check" for non-HVAC trades).

**Data Sources & Interconnections**:
- **Core Data**: Mobile pulls from the same backend as desktop (SQL Server via API, with SQLite local cache for offline)—e.g., jobs/sites/assets from shared entities, prepopulated with tech's role/territory (from Employees/Settings). Local cache ensures efficiency (e.g., load assigned jobs offline, sync changes like time logs or quick notes on reconnect).
- **Interconnections** (Mobile-Focused Flow for Shared Data):
  - **Jobs/Calendar/Estimates/Service Agreements**: Primary focus—mobile syncs assigned jobs (filter by tech's territory/cert from Employees), with data transfer from desktop scheduling (e.g., site access notes prepopulate work order, agreement visits show as recurring slots). App flow: Job detail on mobile pulls calendar snippet (transfer to status updates), auto-logs time to Employees/payroll on close.
  - **Sites/Customers/Companies/Assets**: Mobile views filtered by tech's assignments (e.g., territorial company sites only)—data from Customers/Sites prepopulates maps/access, Assets history transfers for on-site repair logs (link to History/Claims). App flow: Site detail embeds asset list (multi-asset per site grouped), with quick "Log Repair" transferring to History.
  - **Material Lists/Inventory/Products/Financials**: Mobile logs material usage (deduct from tech's truck inventory, transfer from lists/products – warn low stock), links to quick invoice preview if post-job payment needed. App flow: Embedded material builder in jobs pulls templates (transfer quantities to deductions/expenses).
  - **Service History & Warranty Claims/Documents/Quick Notes/Employees**: Mobile logging hub—quick notes/documents upload (camera to evidence, transfer to History/Claims/Assets); employee time clock (punch in/out with GPS/site tie-in) transfers to payroll. App flow: History/Claims form embeds from assets/jobs (transfer evidence to resolutions/reimbursements).
  - **Settings/Notifications/Audit Logs/Reports**: Mobile accesses limited Settings (e.g., personal prefs like theme/dark mode), full Notifications center (bell for alerts like "New Job Assigned"), and simplified Reports (e.g., "My Performance KPIs"). Data from Settings propagates (e.g., trade mode adapts dropdowns like "System Type" to "Pipe Type" for plumbing). App flow: Notification click transfers to relevant mobile page (e.g., "Overdue Claim" to History detail).
  - **Shared Data Flow**: Desktop creates job (assigns to tech with territorial filter) → Mobile syncs (prepopulate job with sites/assets/lists/notes from shared entities) → Tech logs time/materials/repairs (transfer to Employees/payroll, deduct inventory, update Assets/History/Claims) → Sync back to desktop (flow to Invoices/Reports/Audits). For multi-site: Mobile batches views (e.g., landlord rentals grouped by estate). Robust: Offline mode caches data (e.g., log repairs local, sync resolves conflicts like duplicate entries).

**Layout & Sections** (Mobile App Focus: Clean, Modern, Work-Focused with Bottom Nav, Gesture-Based for Techs):
- **Overall Structure**: Bottom navigation bar for core access (persistent, 4-5 icons for thumb reach), with top header for page title/search/notifications. Full-screen views for details (vertical scroll to avoid clutter), swipe gestures for actions (e.g., swipe job card to "Start"), and floating action button (FAB) for quick creates (e.g., new quick note/doc upload). Modern aesthetics: Clean lines, ample spacing, high-contrast colors (light/dark theme from Settings), icons for quick recognition (e.g., toolbox for jobs). Layout optimizes for one-handed use (techs often on ladders/sites), with large tappable areas and minimal text (icons + labels). Data efficiency: Lazy load details (e.g., asset history expands on tap), offline indicators (e.g., "Sync Pending" badge on unsynced logs).
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Core tabs for tech workflow (swipe between, customizable order in Settings/Mobile Prefs):  
  - **Home/Dashboard**: Simplified tech view—immediate concerns (e.g., "Today's Jobs" cards clickable to details, "Unscheduled Emergencies" alerts, quick time clock punch).  
  - **Jobs**: Assigned jobs list (cards with site map snippet, asset summary—swipe to "EnRoute/Complete").  
  - **Calendar**: Daily/weekly view (list of events with time slots—tap to detail, drag limited for reschedule if allowed).  
  - **Quick Notes/Documents**: Combined for fast capture (upload FAB, search vault—tap to view/preview linked docs).  
  - **Me/Team** (or More): Personal employee profile (time logs/pay stubs, certs), simple reports (e.g., "My Performance KPIs").  
- **Header (Fixed Top, 50-60px)**: App logo (tap to Home), page title, search icon (expands full-screen for touch), notifications bell (dropdown list with tap-to-action, e.g., "New Job" ? Jump to Jobs). Right: User avatar (dropdown: Theme toggle, Settings subset like "Mobile Sync Prefs," Logout).  
- **Main Content Area**: Full-screen per tab, vertical scroll for details. Common patterns:  
  - **Lists/Cards**: Stacked cards (e.g., jobs: Card with site address/map, asset badge, material summary—tap expand for full, swipe left for actions like "Log Time").  
  - **Details**: Accordion sections (e.g., job detail: "Site Info" tap expands access notes/map; "Assets" lists multi-assets per site with history glimpses).  
  - **Forms/Editors**: Large inputs (full-width for touch), dropdowns with search (prepopulated/customizable from Settings—e.g., "System Type" shows HVAC defaults but switches in trade mode), voice/camera buttons (e.g., for quick notes/docs uploads).  
  - **Charts/KPIs (in Reports Embed)**: Simplified mobile cards (e.g., "My Hours This Week: 35/40" progress bar—tap for detail chart).  
- **FAB (Floating Action Button)**: Bottom-right on relevant tabs (e.g., on Jobs: "New Quick Note/Log Repair"; on Documents: "Upload Doc"—contextual, auto-links to current job/site/asset).  
- **Footer**: Minimal/minimized (e.g., sync status toast/banner when offline— "Pending Sync: 2 Logs" with "Sync Now" button).  

**UX Interactions & Flows**:
- **Core Workflow**: Login (simple static form with role-based redirect to Home) → Home shows "Assigned Jobs Today" cards (tap card ? Detail with site map, asset history, material list embed—swipe "Start Job" ? Auto-clocks time with GPS/site check).  
- **Connectivity Flow**: Tap job card → Embedded site details (access notes/map from Sites—data transfer for navigation); add material (scan from Inventory—transfer to list deduction); log repair (transfer to Assets/History/Claims).  
- **Home to Detail**: Filter jobs (dropdown like "Emergency Only"—prepopulated/customizable) → Tap ? Detail with accordions (expand "Assets" for multi-asset site view).  
- **User Journey**: Tech logs in (biometric if set in Settings) → Home: "3 Jobs Today" (territorial filter applied from Employees) → Tap job for landlord multi-rental (site group with assets) → Swipe "EnRoute" (GPS auto-start time) → At site, tap "Log Repair" (voice/note/photo—transfer to Quick Notes/Documents/History/Claims) → Close job (transfer to Invoices draft, update Assets/payroll).  
- **Efficiency Features**: Prepopulated dropdowns (e.g., "Repair Type: Leak" – customizable in Settings for trades like "Overload" in electrical); voice input for notes/logs (hands-free on ladders); camera for docs/evidence (auto-link to current job/asset/site); swipe gestures (e.g., swipe job to "Complete," material item to "Deduct"); contextual suggestions (e.g., "Suggest Material from Template" based on asset history).

**Customizations & Configurability**:
- Admins (Settings > Mobile): Toggle features (e.g., "Require GPS for Clock-In: On/Off"); customize bottom nav (reorder/add tabs like "Inventory" for techs); set offline cache limits (e.g., "Cache 50 Recent Jobs"); trade mode adapts UI (e.g., HVAC: "Refrigerant Check" prompts; Plumbing: "Leak Detection" icons). Per-user/role: Techs customize prefs (e.g., "Default to Calendar on Open"); light/dark theme (global toggle, but per-user override).
- Quick Notes/Documents: FAB customization (e.g., "Default Category: Repair" for techs).

**Edge Cases & Robustness**:
- Offline Mode: Full support (cache assigned jobs/sites/assets/docs—log time/repairs/notes local; sync on reconnect with conflict resolution, e.g., "Duplicate Log—Merge?"). Warn "Offline: Changes Pending" banner.
- Multi-Site/Territorial: UI filters auto-apply (e.g., tech's territory limits job list; multi-rental sites group assets in detail accordions).
- Small Screens: Large tappable areas (min 48px for buttons); no horizontal scrolls (vertical layouts only); keyboard auto-focus on forms.
- Permissions: Techs limited UI (no financial tabs; read-only history); admins full (but mobile warns "Best on Desktop").
- Errors: Graceful (e.g., "Sync Failed—Retry?" button); validation (e.g., "Required: Photo for Claim" inline).

**Integrations & Automation**:
- Triggers: Job close → Alert (e.g., "Log to History?"); low battery/signal → Auto-sync.
- External: GPS (for clock-in/site verification – toggle in Settings); camera/voice APIs (for notes/docs); push notifications (for new assignments – customizable in Settings).
- Workflow Ties: Quick actions ensure progression (e.g., "From Job Detail to Quick Note" → FAB opens with job pre-linked, transfer to Documents/History on save). For companies: Territorial push (e.g., notify tech for East job only).

**Mobile Considerations** (Native App Focus, with Web Fallback):  
The native app (e.g., .NET MAUI) ensures optimal performance (fast loads, native controls like camera/GPS), but web fallback uses responsive design (media queries for bottom nav, card stacks) to mimic without issues—e.g., no dynamic rendering pitfalls on login (static as discussed), with shared data sync (API pushes from desktop to mobile for consistency).
