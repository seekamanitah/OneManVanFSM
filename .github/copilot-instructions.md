# Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines
- Always refer to guideline texts in the "OneManVanFSM Guidelines" folder for app design direction.
- Always consult guidelines when developing features.
- Notify user of any conflicts between guidelines and requirements.
- Avoid quick fixes over proper fixes. Always implement root-cause solutions rather than surface-level patches. Time is irrelevant — correctness and robustness are the priority.

## Code Style
- Use specific formatting rules.
- Follow naming conventions.
- When styling tabs, buttons, and interactive elements, always use the app's darker blue (primary) color — never light/muted blues. Ensure consistent use of the primary dark blue for active states and interactive elements across all pages.
