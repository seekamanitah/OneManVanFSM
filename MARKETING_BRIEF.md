---

## 3. Target Market

### Primary Audience
- **Solo HVAC contractors** ("one man and a van") who need professional-grade tools without enterprise complexity or pricing
- **Small HVAC companies** (1–15 employees) running residential and light commercial work
- **Owner-operators** who handle everything from bidding to billing and need it all in one place

### Secondary Audience
- **Small plumbing contractors** — trade mode adapts all terminology and workflows
- **Small electrical contractors** — same adaptability for circuit/panel/wiring workflows
- **General contractors and handymen** managing mixed-trade jobs
- **Property maintenance companies** servicing landlords with multi-site portfolios
- **Franchise/chain maintenance** — territorial contact routing for multi-location companies

### Customer Profiles
- **The Solo Contractor**: One person doing estimates, installs, repairs, invoicing — needs everything accessible from a phone while on a ladder
- **The Small Team Owner**: 3–8 techs to dispatch, track time, manage certifications, run payroll — needs a dispatch board and team oversight
- **The Growing Business**: 10–15 employees, multiple company vehicles (truck stock tracking), service agreements for recurring revenue — needs analytics and scalability
- **The Landlord's Contractor**: Manages multi-rental properties with varying assets at each site — needs multi-site/multi-asset organization
- **The Multi-Trade Operator**: Expanding from HVAC into plumbing — needs one-click trade mode switching without losing data

---

## 4. Problem Statement

### What Small Contractors Face Today
1. **Subscription Fatigue**: ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber — $50–$500+/month/user just to run your business. Over 3 years, that's $1,800–$18,000+ in rent for software you never own.
2. **Overkill Software**: Enterprise tools designed for 500+ employee companies. 80% of features are irrelevant, the UI is complex, training takes weeks.
3. **Data Silos**: Customer info in one app, invoices in another, scheduling in a calendar, inventory in a spreadsheet. Nothing talks to each other.
4. **No Offline Access**: Field techs lose signal at remote sites, basements, and attics — exactly where they need the app most.
5. **Loss of Control**: Your business data lives on someone else's servers. They raise prices? You pay or lose everything. They shut down? Your data goes with them.
6. **Generic Tools**: Built for "any business" but designed for none. No understanding of HVAC-specific needs like refrigerant tracking, SEER ratings, or EPA compliance.

### The OneManVanFSM Answer
**Own your tools. Own your data. Run your business.**

---

## 6. Unique Selling Points (USPs)

### 1. 🏷️ One-Time Purchase — No Subscriptions, Ever
Pay once, own it forever. No monthly fees, no per-user pricing, no surprise rate increases. Your software investment appreciates instead of bleeding you dry.

### 2. 🔒 Self-Hosted — Your Data, Your Control
Run it on your own server or a $5/month cloud VPS. No vendor lock-in. No one can raise your price, limit your features, or shut you down. Full data sovereignty.

### 3. 📱 Desktop + Mobile — One Unified System
Full-featured web app for the office. Native mobile app for the field. Same data, same workflows, seamless sync. Build an estimate on desktop → tech sees it on their phone instantly.

### 4. 📡 Offline-First Mobile
Techs work in basements, attics, and remote sites. The mobile app caches everything locally and syncs when connectivity returns. Log time, materials, and repairs without signal — nothing is lost.

### 5. 🔧 Built for HVAC, Adaptable for Any Trade
HVAC-specific out of the box (SEER ratings, refrigerant tracking, EPA cert management, duct system types). One-click trade mode switching adapts all dropdowns and terminology for plumbing, electrical, or general contracting — no app rework needed.

### 6. 🔗 Everything Connected — Zero Re-Entry
Data flows automatically between modules. An estimate's material list carries to the job → tech logs materials on mobile → inventory deducts → asset gets created → invoice auto-generates with labor and materials. One entry, everywhere.

### 7. 🌙 Dark Mode Built In
Full dark theme across the entire application. Not an afterthought — designed from the ground up for comfortable use in any lighting condition.

### 8. 🐳 Docker-Ready Deployment
Deploy with a single `docker-compose up` command. Production-ready containerization for easy hosting, backup, and scaling.

## 11. Pricing & Business Model

### Philosophy
Software should be a tool you own, not a tax you pay. Every month you pay a subscription, that money is gone forever. With OneManVanFSM, your investment stays with you.

### Model
- **One-Time Purchase** — Pay once, own forever
- **No Per-User Fees** — Add unlimited users at no extra cost
- **No Feature Gating** — Every feature included, no "upgrade to unlock"
- **Self-Hosted** — Run on your hardware or any VPS ($5–$20/month hosting vs. $50–$500/month SaaS)
- **Optional Support** — Paid support packages available for those who want it
- **Updates** — Free updates included (community-driven improvements)

### ROI Calculator Talking Points
- **Break-even in Month 1** — vs. monthly subscription costs
- **3-Year Savings** — $5,000–$15,000+ compared to ServiceTitan/Housecall Pro
- **No Surprise Increases** — Price locked at time of purchase, forever
- **Data Freedom** — Export everything, anytime. No vendor lock-in penalty.

## 12. Competitive Comparison

### Why NOT ServiceTitan
- $245–$500+/month minimum
- Designed for 50–500+ employee companies
- Overly complex for solo/small teams
- Long-term contracts with cancellation penalties
- Your data lives on their servers

### Why NOT Housecall Pro
- Per-user pricing adds up fast with growing teams
- Limited inventory tracking
- No asset lifecycle management
- No offline mobile support
- No self-hosting option

### Why NOT Jobber
- Monthly subscription model
- Generic (not trade-specific)
- Limited inventory and asset features
- No warranty/service history tracking
- No document vault

### Why NOT Spreadsheets + Google Calendar
- Data silos — nothing connects
- No mobile app for field techs
- No automation (manual invoice creation, no stock tracking)
- No audit trail
- Unprofessional customer-facing documents

### Why OneManVanFSM Wins
- **All features, one price, forever**
- **Built for trades, not "any business"**
- **Your data, your server, your control**
- **Offline-first for real fieldwork conditions**
- **Every module connected — zero re-entry**

## 18. FAQ for Marketing Site

### General
**Q: What is OneManVanFSM?**
A: It's a complete field service management platform built for small trade contractors — HVAC, plumbing, and electrical. It handles customers, estimates, jobs, scheduling, inventory, invoicing, service agreements, and more in one integrated system.

**Q: Is this really a one-time purchase?**
A: Yes. You pay once and own the software forever. No monthly fees, no per-user charges, no feature gating. The only ongoing cost is your hosting ($5–$20/month for a VPS, or free on your own hardware).

**Q: Who made this?**
A: Christopher Eikel of MtnManApps. Built by a real person who believes contractors shouldn't rent their tools.

### Technical
**Q: What do I need to run it?**
A: Any server that runs Docker — a $5/month cloud VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.), a spare PC, or even a Raspberry Pi. The Docker setup is one command: `docker-compose up`.

**Q: Is there a mobile app?**
A: Yes — native Android and iOS apps built with .NET MAUI. They sync with the web app and work fully offline for field techs.

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: The mobile app works completely offline. Techs can view jobs, log time, record materials, take photos, and write notes without internet. Everything syncs automatically when connectivity returns.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Your data lives on YOUR server. Not ours, not a third party's. You control access, backups, and security. JWT authentication and role-based permissions protect every action within the app.

### Features
**Q: Can I use it for plumbing/electrical, not just HVAC?**
A: Absolutely. One-click trade mode switching in Settings adapts all terminology, dropdowns, and templates. HVAC's "System Type: Spider/Trunk" becomes plumbing's "Pipe Layout: Copper/PVC" instantly.

**Q: Can I import my existing data?**
A: Yes. CSV import tools for every entity — customers, products, inventory, and more. Build templates in Excel and import them directly.

**Q: Does it integrate with QuickBooks?**
A: Integration points are built in for QuickBooks (invoices, payments, expenses), Stripe (card payments), and Twilio (SMS notifications).

**Q: Can multiple people use it at the same time?**
A: Yes. Unlimited users with role-based access control. The owner, dispatchers, office staff, and field techs all use the same system with permissions appropriate to their role.

### Pricing
**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: One-time purchase. Visit [chillwiththepenguin.com/onemanvanfsm](https://chillwiththepenguin.com/onemanvanfsm) for current pricing.

**Q: Are there any hidden fees?**
A: None. The only ongoing cost is server hosting if you choose cloud hosting ($5–$20/month). No per-user fees, no feature tiers, no support surcharges for basic help.

**Q: What if I need help setting it up?**
A: Documentation and Docker deployment guides are included. Optional paid setup assistance is available for those who want hands-on help.
